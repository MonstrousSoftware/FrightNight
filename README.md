# Fright Night

Entry for LibGDX Gam Jam #26 (September 2023).

![](thumbnail.png)

This is a 3D first person game where you wander around a road, corn fields, a church and a graveyard and are accosted by hell-hounds, zombies and a motor vehicle.
Despite having no weapons, your task is to be the sole survivor and ride off into the sunset. How to beat the game is for the player to figure out as a puzzle, although the game offers some hints.

The game features models created in Blender, including some animated ones, rendered using gdx-gtlf.  The web version makes use of the gdx-teavm extension.
The desktop version has support for controllers. Features 3d lightning effect. Rain particles. Decals for the cornfield. Some fancy shader effects on the intro and exit screen.  Voice narration with subtitles. 
Quick-save (F5) and reload (F9).
