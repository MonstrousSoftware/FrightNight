// needed? gdx-teavm in version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

- It seems gdx-teavm doesn't support controllers as they require reflection.
- since on web Gdx.app.exit doesn't close the window we need to handle game exit differently. Return to 'press any key'?
- need a 'press any key to start' screen to allow sound in the title screen on web.
FIXED - on web the sound keeps playing after exitscreen completes, despite the sound.stop();
- F11 in any menu screen toggles fullscreen/window (doesn't play nicely with the options screen on web)
- ESC doesn't work while BACK does in menu's
- sound volume control (music?)
- credits screen
- save preferences
- game icons
