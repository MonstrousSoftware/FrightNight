// needed? gdx-teavm in version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

- It seems gdx-teavm doesn't support controllers as they require reflection.
- since on web Gdx.app.exit doesn't close the window we need to handle game exit differently. Return to 'press any key'?
- need a 'press any key to start' screen to allow sound in the title screen on web.
FIXED - on web the sound keeps playing after exitscreen completes, despite the sound.stop();
- F11 in any menu screen toggles fullscreen/window (doesn't play nicely with the options screen on web)
- ESC doesn't work while BACK does in menu's
FIXED - web version doesn't catch the cursor, you cannot look all around.  Use A and D keys to turn instead of strafe. Strafing was moved to Q and E.
- (minor) crouching (even though it is useless) is too jerky.
- sound volume control (music?)
DONE - credits screen
- save preferences
- game icons
IMPROVED - font missing some characters and small h has some surplus white
- road texture does not appear on web
